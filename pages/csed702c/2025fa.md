## CSED702C: Binary Analysis and Exploitation (ÌäπÎ°†: Î∞îÏù¥ÎÑàÎ¶¨ Î∂ÑÏÑù Î∞è Í≥µÍ≤©)

The intended audience of this course is graduate students who are interested
in studying practical software security. We will cover advanced techniques
for analyzing binaries, crafting exploits for security vulnerabilities, and
developing mitigation strategies. Students will engage in hands-on
Capture-The-Flag (CTF) style lab challenges to actively apply and practice
the techniques learned.

Course Goals:
- Comprehend low-level program execution
- Gain hands-on experiences in reverse engineering and debugging
- Learn about various types of vulnerabilities and their security implications
- Develop skills for identifying vulnerability and crafting exploits
