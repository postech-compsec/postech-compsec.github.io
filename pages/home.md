## Computer Security Lab at POSTECH

> "Practical cyber-physical security:
> We hack, we patch, we secure real-world systems."

Our research group focuses on addressing **cybersecurity challenges**
across diverse interdisciplinary domains.
Our primary goal is to enhance the security and robustness
of a wide spectrum of computer systems,
ranging from `traditional software` and `operating systems`
to emerging systems such as
`Cyber-Physical Systems` (e.g., drones, autonomous vehicles, satellite systems)
and `Artificial Intelligence systems`.

Our research methodology encompasses various approaches,
including, but not limited to:
1. Developing automated methodologies for scalable bug identification.
2. Exploring offensive techniques to diagnose vulnerabilities in
existing systems.
3. Engineering secure and robust systems.

Ultimately, our overarching goal is to make practical impacts on
the cyber-physical safety of individuals who rely on computer-based systems
in their daily lives.

**NOTE:** If you are interested in working with us,
