Our research group focuses on addressing **cybersecurity challenges** across various interdisciplinary domains.
Our primary objective is to enhance the security and robustness of a wide spectrum of computer systems,
ranging from traditional software and Operating Systems to emerging systems such as
Cyber-Physical Systems (e.g., drones, autonomous vehicles) and Artificial Intelligence systems.

Our research methodology includes, but not limited to:
1. the development of automated methodologies for scalable bug identification,
2. the exploration of offensive techniques to diagnose vulnerabilities in
existing systems,
3. the engineering of secure and robust systems.

Ultimately, our overarching goal is to make practical impacts on the
cyber-physical safety of individuals who rely on computer-based systems in
their daily lives.
