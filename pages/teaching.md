## **Teaching**

Our lab offers hands-on, system-oriented cybersecurity courses that bridge
foundational theory and real-world application. We currently teach the
following courses at POSTECH:


### CSED415: Computer Security (컴퓨터 보안)

This course introduces the **fundamental concepts and principles of computer
security**, covering a broad range of topics such as software security,
cryptography, system and network security. Students gain practical experience
through hands-on lab assignments and a team-based final project.

* Audience: Senior-level undergraduate students
* Syllabus & materials: [2024sp](/teaching/csed415/2024sp), [2025sp](/teaching/csed415/2025sp)
* Course reviews:
  > "보안쪽에, 그리고 시스템쪽에 조금이라도 관심이 있다면 꼭 들어봤으면 하는
     강의. 대략적으로만 알던 지식을 구체적으로 알 수 있게 해준 강의"

  > "교수님께서 정말 친절하십니다. 보안쪽에 관심 있으면 꼭 듣는거 추천합니다."

  > "강의 자료가 이해하는 데에 있어서 다른 어떤 수업보다도 효과적입니다."

  > "Professor is skilled at teaching, enthusiastic, and close to students."


### CSED702C: Binary Analysis and Exploitation (바이너리 분석 및 공격)

This course covers **practical techniques** for analyzing binaries and crafting
real-world exploits. Topics include binary analysis, vulnerability discovery,
exploit development, and mitigation strategies. Students apply and deepen their
understanding of the topics through guided, hands-on CTF-style lab challenges.

* Audience: Graduate students interested in advanced software security
* Syllabus & materials: [2024fa](/teaching/csed702c/2024fa), [2025fa](/teaching/csed702c/2025fa)
* 🏆 **Excellence Prize**, POSTECH Student-Centered Teaching and Learning Model Competition (Fall 2024)
* Course reviews:
  > "system 분야에 관심이 있다면 꼭 한번 들어보면 좋을 것 같은, 좋은 수업이다."

  > "너무 흥미롭고 준비가 완벽한 강의."

  > "시스템 해킹에 관심이 있는 사람에게는 최고의 강의라고 생각합니다."

  > "I really enjoyed this course and I am very thankful that I got to be
     exposed to the foundational concepts of binary analysis."
