### Target: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)

* Lead: Prof. Seulbae Kim
* Subject systems: robots, drones, autonomous vehicles, satellites, ...

###### 1. Verification of logic/algorithm implementation
* Key question: Are there any discrepancies between the intended
logic/algorithm and the actual software implementation?
* Reference:
  [RoboFuzz](https://seulbae-security.github.io/pubs/robofuzz-fse22.pdf),
  [DriveFuzz](https://seulbae-security.github.io/pubs/drivefuzz-ccs22.pdf)

###### 2. Tailoring automated software testing techniques for distributed CPS codebases
* Key question: Can we tailor existing testing techniques/metrics
to CPS codebases that are designed as distributed systems?

###### 3. Policy and testing methodologies for live/production systems
* Key question: How to guarantee safety of production systems during tests?

###### 4. Analysis/discovery of physical attack vectors
* Key question: Can we systematically attack the software (or the entire cyber-physical system)
through physical attacks?
* Reference:
  [Acoustic attack](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-son.pdf)

###### 5. Creative attacks on sensor and perception layers
* Key question: How can we (silently) fool the eyes and brain of a cyber-physical system
to (maliciously) affect its behavior?
* Reference: [Frustum attack](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22-hallyburton.pdf)

###### 6. Resource-constrained testing
* Key question: Many CPS have limited computing power and memory. Can we
quickly reveal issues associated when these resources are scarce?

###### 7. Cyber-physical security by design
* Key question: Can we carefully design the components of CPS to guarantee security?
(e.g., by having secure channel between the hardware and software)

###### 8. Exploring (the imperfectness of) physics simulators
* Key question: Three-dimensional physics simulators are widely used for
robotic development and testing. Are there any potential caveats caused by the flaws of the simulators?

### Target: Operating Systems and Large Software Systems

* Lead: Prof. Seulbae Kim
* Subject systems: Linux/Windows Kernel, web browsers, ...

###### 1. Automatically identifying non-memory issues (e.g., performance deradation)
* Key question: How to design test oracles and testing methodologies for the issues
that do not readily manifest (e.g., performance degradation)?

###### 2. Efficiently testing emulated systems
* Key question: Emulation comes at a cost of (terrible) performance.
Can we somehow skip the slow part for testing purposes?

###### 3. Improving fuzzing methodologies
* Keywords: Directed fuzzing, AI-assisted fuzzing, in-memory fuzzing, ...

###### 4. Automated Game testing
* Reference: [Towards automated video game testing: still a long way to go](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3524494.3527627)

### Target: AI/ML Security
* Lead: Prof. Sangdon Park
* Subject systems: Generative AI, Robot AI

###### 1. Find vulnerabilites of Generative AI!
* Can we find prompts of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate sensitive information?
* You can suggest the rest to me!

###### 2. Secure Generative AI via ML!
* Can we unlearn sensitive information from LLMs?
* You can suggest the rest to me!

###### 3. Find vulnerabilites of Robot AI!
* Can we find adverarial attacks to drive robots to unsafe states?
* You can suggest the rest to me!

###### 4. Secure Robot AI via ML!
* Can we learn individual AI for securing Robot AI?
* You can suggest the rest to me!

### Target: Code
* Lead: Prof. Sangdon Park
* Subject systems: many program code
  
###### 1. Find vulnerabilites of code using LLMs!
* Can we learn LLMs to find vulnerability of code and patch the code?
* You can suggest the rest to me!
